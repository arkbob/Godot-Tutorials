First thing you see is project manager when you open Godot. You can open templates, create new projects, import projects, change the language the editor uses on this screen, and much more on this screen.
You will spend most of your time on Godot on this page.
You can also press Ctrl + F2(alt + 2 on a mac) to open the 3d project editor.  This is for editing 3d projects(duh).
You can also press Ctrl + F3(alt + 3 on a mac) to open the code editor. This is where you can edit the actual physical code of the project you are doing.
Instancing allows you to divide scenes, make scenes easier to manage, manage edit multiple nodes of instances at once, organize and embed complex game flows.
There are four languages you can use while using Godot: Gdscript, VisualScript, C#, and C+++. However, C# and C+++ have to be edited on different ides to be used on Godot, making them inconveinet to use.
GDscript is a coding language similar to python that loads and compiles really fast.
VisualScript is a visual "blocks and connections" implementation of how Godot works. It is easy to use and simple enough for non-programmers to understand.
