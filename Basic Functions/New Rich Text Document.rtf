First thing you see is project manager when you open Godot. You can open templates, create new projects, import projects, change the language the editor uses on this screen, and much more on this screen.
You will spend most of your time on Godot on this page.
You can also press Ctrl + F2(alt + 2 on a mac) to open the 3d project editor.  This is for editing 3d projects(duh).
You can also press Ctrl + F3(alt + 3 on a mac) to open the code editor. This is where you can edit the actual physical code of the project you are doing.
